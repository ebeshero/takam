a. let $shakes := collection('/db/apps/shakespeare/data/')//TEI - nothing without a return line
b. 
let $shakes := collection('/db/apps/shakespeare/data/')//TEI
let $speak := $shakes//speaker
return $speak => count() - I returned 31054 results!
c.
let $distSpeak := $speak => distinct-values()
return $distSpeak - I'm getting all unique speakers, but some look like they aren't speakers. "some" was actually a speaker according to this.
d. 
let $distSpeak := $speak => distinct-values()
return $distSpeak => count() - I returned 966 values.
e. 
let $distSpeak := $speak => distinct-values()
for $p in $shakes
    let $dsp := $p//speaker => distinct-values()
    let $title := $p//titleStmt/title
    let $dspCount := $dsp => count()
    where $dspCount > 50
return ($title || " : " || $dspCount)
I returned the titles of plays with greater than 50 speakers!
2. 
for $p in $shakes
    let $dsp := $p//speaker => distinct-values()
    let $title := $p//titleStmt/title
    let $dspCount := $dsp => count()
    let $uri := $p => base-uri()
    where $dspCount > 50
return ($title || " : " || $dspCount || " : " || $uri)

I got the base uri to appear, and it looks like we already got the text to not have its title tag wrapped, even though we didn't send it to a string or text function...
