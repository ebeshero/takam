			Pink Floyd ROIO List

Pink Floyd has been very popular for long time; as a result, there are many
PF bootlegs out there.  A roio is the same thing as a boot.  Because of the
number of different roios, it was necessary to compile a "catalog" of them.
I've compiled this catalog from existing info, which can be gotten from the PF
email server at echoserv@fawnya.tcs.com.  On the server, each of the roios is
listed individually, which is a real pain if you just want to browse through
them and get an idea of what to but at the next show.  So, I've taken those
files and "compressed" them into this list.  

I have not included any file from the server in which the tracks were not
listed.  Also, I have not included any interview discs.  Finally, all of the
titles listed here are CDs.  

There are three separate files: 2 for PF (too much text), and one for solo
stuff..  Have fun...

Each entry has the following characteristics:
	
	Title:    self-explanatory
	Catalog:  used to differentiate between boots of the same name
	Source:   where & when it was recorded
	Tracks:   again self-explanatory.  The songs listed are the ones
		  played, not necessary listed on the cover.
	Xref:	  other roios with the same material
	Quality:  Bootleg sound quality.  I've used the following categories:
		  EX       :  perfect quality, could be a legitimate release
		  VG	   :  almost perfect, maybe some crowd noise
		  GD	   :  some hiss, but very listenable
		  FR	   :  more hiss, but somewhat tolerable
	          PR	   :  still more hiss, but NOT tolerable
	Comments: Anything not covered in the previous sections.

                              Live USA, New York Live 1977

Quality:   Ex/VG+  ( although it is an audience recording )

Comments:  This is a collection of three other roio's; A69, BoT72 and
           WTtM (see Xref). It sounds like this one is copied from those
           three mentioned (from The Swingin' Pig label) as they have
           no tape hiss at all. Only drawback is that the high notes
           are slightly wobbling from time to time.

           Set 1: Has some tracks that not often shows up on roio's,
                  like 'Biding My Time' (PF doing Jazz) which is a great
                  tune. A lot of very nice improvisations between the
                  songs. Gilmour's voice isn't at the best during this
                  show.
           Set 2: A great 'early' performance of DSotM. It has the 'On
                  The Run' jam, 'Time' is the slow version and TGGItS has
                  the preachers tapes. 'Time' and 'Us And Them' are cut down,
                  and Eclipse is faded out a little early.

           6. Careful With That Axe, Eugene
           7. The Narrow Way/Part 3

Quality:   VG+ 

Comments:  Interesting recording. It contains material which seldom appears
	   on other roios. The record is processed with NoNoise,
	   but that can't repair the bad source tape. Nevertheless it's
	   the best roio from that early Floyd period.
	  "Amsterdam '69" is one of about 4 known performances of "The
	  Man" and "The Journey."  This roio contains all but the final
	  three parts of the the show, as it does not include "The Pink
	  Jungle (Pow R Toc H)," "Behold the Temple of Light," or "The
	  End of the Beginning (Celestial Voices)."

          12. One Of These Days                [7.48]


Quality:   GD

Comments:  This early DSoTM set is very much like the "The Best Of
           Tour 72" recording; but, unlike the latter, this includes
           all the songs uncut. "The Great Gig In The Sky" contains
           the piano parts, but is still without vocals. "Echoes" lasts 20:00
           and there's a very fast and powerful "One Of These Days".

	   The sound is dull, although the noise level is tolerable.
	   What really makes you cry is the wrong speed. The whole
	   record is taken from a vinyl which was recorded at a slower
	   speed (for capacity reasons), and played at normal speed.
	   Therefore everything is too fast, too high.

          10. Eclipse                   1:20

Quality:  VG  ( remastered with NoNoise ) 

Comments:  This one - containing one of the very first DSoTM performances 
           - is in fact,a historical recording! For example, the instrumentals
           that form On The Run, The Great Gig In The Sky and
           Any Colour You Like are completely different and very
           interesting. Some tracks are badly cut: Us And Them is
           reduced to under three minutes, Time has been chopped
           too, and the end of Eclipse is faded out!

Comments:  Sheep is announced as "Raving And Drooling I Fall On His Neck
           With A Scream" and there is a tape played before the song starts.
           The versions of Sheep and Dogs are a little different than the 75
           and 77 versions of these songs.  Very little audience noise.
           Note:  that this is an audience, there is some crowd noise.

Comments:  Relatively easy to find. Concert is from Hollywood
           Bowl 22.9.72 except CD1 from London 17.2.72, due to
           defects on the original tapes. This is the same as
           Crackers vinyl roio, complete with numerous
           crackles.

Comments:  A complete 1975 US concert! Most enjoyable are the
           performances of "Gotta Be Crazy", which is different to
           both the 74 and 77 (Dogs) versions, and one of the last
           pre-87 "Echoes", with very nice sax solos.

           Tape hiss and distortion on the louder tracks, sound
           effects is clear and good. Good stereo. This is a really
           good performance by Pink Floyd, especially 'Atom Heart
           Mother' and 'Cymbaline' with a long segment where PF shows
           of their quad sound effects.

Comments:  Fat Old Sun is drawn out to twice the length and features the Floyd
           improvising like mad around the basic theme. Cymbaline is similarly
           extended and feature the famous 'footsteps' sequence, which
           allowed the group to show off their quadraphonic sound

Quality:   EX (studio) 

Comments:
        TIME--no solo lead guitar after "started gun"...no Breathe reprise 

        BRAIN DAMAGE--no laughing on fade up..."lunatic is in my head"
        fade up is different from what precedes on record (which is 
        chorus instead of instrumental section)..."if cloud burst..." has
        lead guitar not on record...no voice speech in next section, but
        lead guitar instead...lead guitar on end after "dark side of the
        moon."

        US AND THEM--sax solo at the beginning has a different ending...
        no echo on voice...sax continues under voice into second verse...
        into "forward he cried"...and next verse, "black and blue" (record
        starts at "who's who" and goes to "up and down")...sax continues
        into "up and down" verse and into "haven't you heard" with no 
        voice over.  On the record the sax is the same take but just 
        mixed in and out.

Comments:  The sound quality is simply fantastic. Only once
           under the "Great Gig In The Sky" are there some
           drop-outs, but these last only a second and are
           therefor harmless.
           Rather more severe, however, are the noise on "Shine
           On...", the live premier from the Palais des Sports,
           Paris '74. It's really not worth listening to more
           than once - just look on it as a bonus track to
           'fill up' the CD.

Quality:   EX-  

Comments:  First a *WARNING*, it is only the first four tracks
           that are from the Knebworth concert, the rest (5,6 & 7)
           is taken from DSoT. They are trying to trick you to believe
           it's from Knebworth by putting in the speaking between
           track 6 and 7 as it was on the concert. This is FRAUD.
           But the tracks that are from the concert is quite good,
           it has some minor radio interferences, but it's not much.
           TGGITS has Claire Torry (who sang it on DSotM) singing it.
           Times are slightly off. This one should be avoided.

Comments:  Despite occasional distortion, sound quality on this CD is
           much better than the Mauerspechte roio, from the same

           is no indication of which songs were recorded when.
           Echoes lacks its slow coda, and Atom Heart Mother features
           the famous "We can play out of tune" orchestra.
