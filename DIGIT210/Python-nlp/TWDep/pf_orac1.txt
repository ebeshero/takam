Subject: is this list still up?

This is a test to find out if this list is still up, and if perhaps
I've been deleted from it for some odd reason.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

> O mighty lord Oracle, who is so bloody hugely magnificent that he/she
> makes Jehovah look like a toilet cleaner in comparison...
>
> Do you like Pink Floyd? If so, what's your favourite album? If not, who
> do you like?

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} Do I like Pink Floyd?!?  Are you kidding!  To me, all human music
} sounds like someone hammering nails into an aluminum can.  If you were
} to listen to my music, it would melt your brain.  Seriously, do you
} think I would have a personal aesthetic opinion on Pink Floyd?  You
} might as well ask, "do you like the sound of two rocks banging
} together?"  The closest humans have ever come to even slightly
} acceptable music is "Hotel California" by the Eagles.  It's the only
} song I can listen to without gnawing my fingers off.
}
} My favorite album is "Death Song of Larsus."  This is no ordinary
} album; it is an Epic achievement.  Let me tell you how it was made.
} Larsus was a bastard child of Zeus and one of the Muses.  (It is still
} not clear which Muse.)  Larsus was a good singer, a VERY good singer.
} He could sing lichen off of rocks.  He could sing rain of of the sky
} and then sing it back into the clouds.  He could sing a man to
} suicidal depression and then to insane joy within the same minute.
} When Larsus sang, the Earth reverberated in harmony.
}
} Well, in an interesting twist of fate, Hera (Zeus's wife) fell in love
} Larsus.  Now Hera can be a wee bit intimidating.  So, when Larsus was
} running for his life from Hera, he accidentally entered the bedroom of
} Athena (Zeus's daughter).  In order to keep Athena quiet, Larsus sang
} her a quiet little love song, and Athena immediately fell in love with
} him.  Let me tell you, these gods have a complicated sex life.  Of
} course, Larsus did not love Athena or Hera, he loved one of the muses,
} Euterpe, who just happened to be a half sister of his mother.  Of
} course, Larsus did not know this since his parentage had always been
} kept secret.  Also, when Larsus was younger, he was told by a seer
} that "the love of a sister would kill him."  Larsus did not know that
} Athena was his sister, but Athena was very good friends with Rondera
} (a very minor diety), and Larsus had been led to believe that
} Rondera's father, Tandera, was also his father.  Tandera would
} occasionally "play ball" with Hera, much to the embarrassment of
} Rondera.  But back to the story.  Athena dragged Larsus before Zeus to
} tell Zeus that they were going to get married.  Zeus, who had been
} trying to marry off Athena for years, gave his approval.  Of course,
} Zeus had long since forgotten who Larsus really was.  Larsus
} complained bitterly that he loved Euterpe instead.  As Larsus said
} this, Hera walked in and became very angry.  In terror Larsus cried
} out for aid from Tandera.  Tandera heard the call and came running.
} When Tandera entered the room and saw that Hera was furious, he kept
} quiet.  Rondera heard all of the commotion and came running also.
} Rondera decided to use this opportunity to get her father, and she
} told Zeus that Hera had been "doing the nasty" with Tandera.  At this,
} Zeus became very angry.  In terror Larsus cried out for aid from
} Euterpe.  When Euterpe entered the room, she lost all composure.  She
} told Hera about the true heritage of Larsus.  Hera turned on Zeus and
} demanded an explanation.  Zeus calmly explained that it was all
} Larsus's fault, and everybody believed him.  After all, Zeus is the
} top god for a reason.  Hera decided to kill Larsus by suspending him
} with a rope over a lake filled with hungry sharks.  The rope would
} slowly fray for a year until finally Larsus dropped into the lake.
} To make a long story short, Larsus tried to save himself by singing
} a very exciting song at the lake.  (My album has this song.)  The song
} encapsulated all of the drama and anguish that he had endured in his
} short life.  The lake became so excited that it boiled, and all
} of the sharks were killed.  At the moment, the rope broke and Larsus
} fell into the lake.  He was immediately turned into a tasty stew.  The
} moral of the story is "you can't bake your lake and meet it too."
}
} Now don't bother me with your silly Pink Floyd.
