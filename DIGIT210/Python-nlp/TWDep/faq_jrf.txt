Who does What, Where and When:
------------------------------

 Syd Barrett (Roger Keith Barrett): Chief singer/songwriter/lead guitarist
  for the Floyd in the early years, up to including PATGOD. Soon after its
  release he was forced to retire from the band due to "illness", but not
  before making an appearance on the Floyd's second album ASFoS. He soon
  afterwards wrote two solo albums (The Madcap Laughs and Barrett) but due
  to his illness, retired from music all together. He apparently now lives
  in Cambridge with his mother, with no intention of returning to music.

 David (Jon) Gilmour: Joined the band in '68, in order to "support" the ailing
  Syd (the idea was, according to Roger Waters, to let Syd carry on writing
  songs, but have Dave actually do Syd's part live), but Syd was to soon leave
  and so Dave took over as lead guitarist, and also took over some of the
  singing. Right up to DSOTM, Dave was also writing his own songs, but from
  DSOTM to The Final Cut, Roger Waters took over in the Lyrics department.
  Dave, released, perhaps reluctantly of this responsibility, did make up
  for it by producing some excellent Guitar, and production work on all
  those albums, most notably Shine On You Crazy Diamond (from WYWH) and
  Comfortably Numb (from The Wall). He also did a large amount of the vocals,
  and it can be argued that he's probably got the best singing voice in the
  band. When Roger Waters split after The Final Cut album Dave decided to
  continue the band, and has now become the chief singer/songwriter/lead
  guitarist. To date, he's made two solo albums (Dave Gilmour and About Face).

 Nick Mason (Nicholas Berkley Mason): 'e does drums! The only member of
  the Floyd to stay the distance, his chief contribution to Floyd music
  is percussion. He has written one song (The Grand Vizier's Garden Party
  on Ummagumma) and has pride of place in speaking the words "One of these
  days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces" on, well, One Of These
  Days (from Meddle). He's released one solo venture (Fictitious Sports)
  and one collaboration piece with Rick Fenn (Profiles). He's also
  renowned for his love of sports cars, and has very expensive and impressive
  collection of them.

 Roger Waters (George Roger Waters): His Rogness, has been singer/songwriter
  /bassist from the very beginning. After the absence of Syd, he gradually
  began to take more control over the Floyd's lyrics, until DSOTM, where
  all lyrics are his. This vein continued through WYWH, and ANIMALS,
  until The Wall, where he began to take control over the music side of
  things too. For The Final Cut, its often been said that this is Roger with
  a few famous backing musicians, as the album is almost totally "his own
  work". After The Final Cut, Roger left the band, and expected the others
  to do likewise, but was surprised to find them wanting to carry it on.
  A few law suits were involved, but resulted in Rog getting not as much as
  he expected. He continues to pursue his solo career, with two quite
  successful solo ventures (The Pro's and Con's Of Hitch Hiking and Radio
  KAOS) and recently "revived" The Wall in Berlin for charity. He has done
  two collaboration pieces, one with Ron Geesin (Music From The Body) which
  dates back to 1970, and one with various other artists, the film
  soundtrack to When The Wind Blows. A new solo piece is expected "very
  soon".

 Rick Wright (Richard William Wright): Keyboards are Mr. Wright's forte
  and from PatGoD up to The Wall, you'll find that not only has tickled
  the ivories (or plastics), but he's also managed to find time to write
  and sing a number of the Floyd's ditties, like TGGITS. However, during
  the making of The Wall film, Mr. Wright "went on holiday", never to
  return until the MLoR tours, where he once again, became a full paid up
  member of the band. Like Mr. Mason, he's written one solo outing (Wet
  Dream) and has done one collaboration piece with Dave Harris under
  the band name of Zee (Identity).

Things That Are Hidden:
-----------------------

Ummagumma:
 LP cover:
  In the mirror on the wall, the last reflection is of the LP cover for 'ASFoS'

Meddle:
 Spoken Words:
   "One of these days I'm gunna cut you into little pieces" spoken by Nick
    Mason.
 Hidden Tunes:
  One Of These Days: during a "quieter" section, you can apparently hear
   Mr Wright, playing a few bars of the Dr Who theme tune.
  Fearless: Crowd at the end are singing "You'll never walk alone", which
   is actually from a Rogers & Hammerstein musical, but was recorded here at
   a Liverpool football (soccer) match. The chant at the end is "Liverpool".
  Echoes: The screeching noises in the middle, are made by Dave using a
   bottleneck on his fender.

Live At Pompeii:
 Things to look out for:
  Nick Mason breaking a drum stick during 'One Of These Days...'
  The Dog in Madmoiselle Nobs, keeping its eyes on the camera.

DSOTM:
 Spoken words:
  Speak To Me:
       "I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, been
        over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands..."
       "I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the
        most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even
        if you're not mad..."
  On The Run:
       [female announcer, announcing flights at airport, including 'Rome']
       "Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, HaHaHaaaaaa!"
  TGGITS:
       "And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I
        don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying?
        There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime."
       "I never said I was frightened of dying"
  Money/ Us & Them:
       "HuHuh! I was in the right!"
       "Yes, absolutely in the right!"
       "I certainly was in the right!"
       "You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a
        bruising!"
       "Yeah!"
       "Why does anyone do anything?"
       "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
       "I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He was asking
        why he wasn't coming up on freely(?) 11, after I was yelling and
        screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely(?) 11.
        It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out"
  Us & Them:
       "I mean, they're not gunna kill ya, so if you give 'em a quick short,
        sharp, shock, they won't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off
        lightly, 'cos I would've given him a thrashing - I only hit him once!
        It was only a difference of opinion, but really...I mean good manners
        don't cost nothing do they, eh?"
  Brain Damage:
       "HuHuHuHu! I can't think of anything to say except, HuHuHuHu! I think
        it's marvellous! HaHaHa!"
  Eclipse:
       "There is no dark side of the moon really. Matter of fact
        it's all dark."
 Hidden Tunes:
  Specifically on the CD versions of the album, there is supposedly some
  music as the heartbeat fades away at the end of Eclipse fades. You basically
  have to turn the volume right the way up at this point, and hopefully you
  will hear a faint jingle being played "as if someone left a radio on in the
  studio". There's some opinion that it might be The Beatles performing Ticket
  To Ride in the studio next door (highly unlikely, as they'd disbanded a
  couple of years before!)

ANP:
 LP cover:
  The phrases that are represented by the pictures on the cover
       'A Frog In The Throught'
       'A Fork In The Road'
       'A Kettle Of Fish'
       'Laughing All The Way To The Bank'
       'A Nip In The Air'
       '...'

WYWH:
 LP cover:
  The Pictures on the various sides of the cover and inner sleeve,
  are there to help display the theme of absence in the Album. In its original
  form, the LP is covered in a black shrink-wrap with the famous shaking hands
  logo - making the cover picture 'absent'. The shaking hands represents a
  false gesture of presence. The Front cover of the album, has two men shaking
  hands, one of whom is on fire - represents someone 'getting burnt' ("Like
  falling in love, and then suddenly being jilted"). The back cover shows a
  Pink Floyd salesman, who is "selling his soul" - he has no wrists, no ankles,
  and no facial features. On the front of the inner-sleeve, you see a man
  diving into the water, but not making a splash - he has presence, but an
  absence of trace. Finally on the back of the inner sleeve, there's the red
  veil - a way of hiding the face. Behind the veil a (nude) figure can be seen.
 Spoken Words:
  Wish You Were Here:
        "...and diciplinary remains, mercifully"
        "Yes, yes. Now with you Derek, this star nonsense..."
        "Yes, yes."
        "Now which is it ..."
        "... I'm sure of it ..."
   [NB. on the WYWH tour, they used to use bits from the local broadcasts of
    the city they were in]

Animals:
 UK/ Rest Of The World Crossover:
  The line "Hey you Whitehouse", doesn't actually mean *THE* Whitehouse in
  Washington, but rather Mrs Mary Whitehouse, UK head of the National Viewers
  and Listeners Association, which campaign for what they consider to be moral
  standards (e.g. no sex on TV, etc.)
 LP cover:
  As much as a painting as it may look, the cover is a photograph of the
  famous London landmark, Battersea Power Station, and, yes, they really did
  float that pig above the chimney stacks. (It got away, but that's another
  story)
 Spoken Words:
  Sheep:
        "THE LORD IS MY SHEPERD, I SHALL NOT WANT
         HE MAKES ME DOWN TO LIE
         THROUGH PASTURES GREEN HE LEADETH ME THE SILENT WATERS BY.
         WITH BRIGHT KNIVES HE RELEASETH MY SOUL.
         HE MAKETH ME TO HANG ON HOOKS IN HIGH PLACES.
         HE CONVERTETH ME TO LAMB CUTLETS.
         FOR LO, HE HATH GREAT POWER, AND GREAT HUNGER.
         WHEN COMETH THE DAY WE LOWLY ONES,
         THROUGH QUIET REFLECTION, AND GREAT DEDICATION,
         MASTER THE ART OF KARATE.
         LO, WE SHALL RISE UP,
         AND THEN WE'LL MAKE THE BUGGERS EYES WATER."

The Wall:

         could...", you can hear an "OOF!" of someone being hit in the
         background.
  Another Brick In The Wall part 2:
        "Wrong, Do it again!"
        "If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you

        "You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddy!"

         Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to
         answer?"
        [Phone rings again...clunk of receiver being picked up]
        "Hello?"
        "This is united states calling, are we reaching...
        [interrupted by phone being put down]
        "See he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering."
        [whirr of connection being closed]
  On Of My Turns:
        "Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?
        [Film in background: "I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you!]
        "This place is bigger than our apartment!
        [Film: "Let me know when you're entering a room"

        [Film: "If you'll just let me know as soon as you can ... Mrs Bancroft"
               "Mrs Bancroft ..."]
        "Hello?"

        "Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
        "Isnt it unsafe to travel at night?"

  The Happiest Days Of Our Lives: The teacher reads a poem from Pink's "Little
   Black Book", and they're actually lyrics from Money from DSOTM, thus:
      "Money, get back, I'm alright jack, keep your hands off my stack.
       New car, caviar, four star day dream, think I'll buy me a football team"
  Stop: contains different lyrics, some of which made their way onto The
   Final Cut, and others onto The Pros And Cons Of Hitch-Hiking, thus:
       "Stooooooooooooooooooooooooooop!!!

        Do you remember me?                         -  Now on Your Possible
        The way we used to be?                      -  Pasts, on The Final Cut
        Do you think we should have been closer?    -

        I put out my hand, just to touch your soft hair         - Now on 5:11am
        To make sure in the darkness, that you were still there - (The Moment
        And I have to admit I was just a little afraid          - of Clarity)
                                                                on Pro's & Cons

        Of the ones within under their dirty old macs           - ?
        and the ones who were pointing the guns in their backs  - ?
        Stop, Stop, I wanna go home...(etc)"

  Goofs:
   When we see the close up of Pink's Mickey Mouse watch, it's on the wrong
   way round...
   ...

The Final Cut:
 Spoken Words:
  The Post War Dream:
       [Car sound, switching on of car radio]
       "...announced plans to build a nuclear fallout shelter at Peterborough
        in Cambridgeshire..."
       [phzzt! of retuning]
       "...three high court judges have cleared the way..."
       [phzzt!]
       "...It was announced today, that the replacement for the Atlantic
        Conveyor the container ship lost in the Falklands conflict would be
        built in Japan, a spokesman for..."
       [phzzt!]
       "...moving in. They say the third world countries, like Bolivia, which
        produce the drug are suffering from rising violence...[fades]"

     "THE PROS AND CONS OF HITCH-HIKING
      (A brief explanation) <- presumably written by Waters

      4:30 AM SCENE I
      (A suburban bedroom somewhere near London)
      "Shane" plays on the TV.
      An Englishman, struggling with a nightmare wakes
      his American wife.
      She speaks.
      Wife:  "Wake up, you're dreaming"
      Man:   "What?"
      Wife:  "You're dreaming"
      The man mumbles disjointedly about his dream.
      His wife soothes him back to sleep.

      4:31 AM SCENE II
      The man returns to his dream.
      He and his wife are driving through continental
      Europe.  There is a vague feeling of threat.
      The European psyche still shrinks from memories
      of The Jackboot.  Borders are dangerous places.
      The law is a fickle friend.
      They pick up two hitch-hikers, a beautiful girl
      and a hooded terrorist...
      Lust conquers fear, the man courts the girl.  His
      sensible family sedan metamorphosis into a mettalic
      green Lamborghini.
      The girl is impressed.
      They go for a drive.
      He is about to seduce her when...  Fear conquers lust.

      4:37 AM SCENE III
      Paralysed by fear, he is whisked back to suburbia
      and attacked in his own home by a gang of Arab
      Terrorists.
      He rages in his impotence.

      4:38 AM SCENE IV
      (A small Hotel overlooking the Rhine)
      The man and the girl eat dinner.
      He takes her upstairs and orders breakfast.
      He locks the door.
      He reaches out for her...

      4:40 AM SCENE V
      Reaching out in his dream he wakes his wife again.
      She is not a pleased woman.
      He is horny.
      She rejects him and goes back to sleep.
      He lies in bed, brittle and angry.
      "Bloody toast crumbs"
      He silently rants.
      "Hey girl, take out the dagger and let's have a
      stab at the sexual revolution."
      He falls asleep again and dreams of a geographical
      solution to his marital problems - They will return
      to his wife's native land and live off it.
      She will be fulfilled.
      They will be happy.

      4:50 AM SCENE VI
      (A cabin in Wyoming)
      The experiment fails.  Through the trials and
      tribulations of self-reliance the couple polarise.
      She falls in love with a "friend from the East".
      They part.

      4:56 AM SCENE VII
      (The edge of a highway - somewhere in the States)
      The man is now alone.
      He is the hitch-hiker.
      A truck pulls up.
      "Hey kid, you looking for a lift?... Get on up here."
      He climbs in and whines to the truck driver.  The
      truck driver, happy to join in the battle of the sexes,
      commiserates for a while.
      Then, realising that our hero is about to vomit all over
      his highly polished cowboy boots, he throws him out
      of the rig.

      5:01 AM SCENE VIII
      (The Gutter)
      Things go from bad to worse.

      5:06 AM SCENE IX
      (A truckstop)
      A waitress with a heart of gold sympathizes with our
      hero reaffirming his basic belief in life and love.
      He wakes.

      5:10 AM SCENE X
      (Back in Suburbia)
      As he awakes our hero experiences a moment of clarity.
      He feels at one with the world.
      He has the answer?   <- N.B. the question mark is Rog's, not mine

      5:11 AM SCENE XI
      (The bedroom - One minute later.)
      The moment fades.
      The man is afraid.
      He reaches out and touches his wife's hair.
      She is awake.
      He loves her..."

  The Story:
      "Radio KAOS by Roger Waters:
        Benny is a welsh coal miner. He is a radio ham. He is 23 years old,
       married to Molly. They have a son, young Ben aged 4, and a new baby.
       They look after Benny's twin brother Billy, who is apparently a
       vegetable. The mine is closed by the market forces. The Male Voice
       Choir stops singing, the village is dying.
        One night Benny takes Billy on a pub crawl. Drunk in a brightly-lit
       shopping mall, Benny vents his anger on a shop window full of multiple
       TV images of Margaret Thatcher's mocking condescension. In defiance,
       he steals a cordless 'phone. Later that night, Benny cavorts
       dangerously on the parapet of a motorway footbridge, in theatrical
       protest at the tabloid press. That same night, a cab driver is killed
       by a concrete block dropped off a similar bridge. The police come to
       question Benny; he hides the cordless 'phone under the cushion of
       Billy's wheelchair.
        Billy is different, he can receive radio waves directly without the
       aid of a tuner; he explores the cordless 'phone, recognising its
       radioness.
        Benny is sent to prison. Billy feels as if half of him has been cut
       off. He misses Benny's nightly conversations with radio hams in
       foreign parts. Molly, unable to cope, sends Billy to stay with his
       great uncle David, who had emigrated to the USA during the war. Much
       as Billy likes Uncle David and the sunshine and all the new radio in
       LA, he cannot adjust to the cultural upheaval and the loss of Benny,
       who for him is "home". Uncle David, now an old man, is haunted by
       having worked on the Manhattan project during World War II, designing
       the Atom Bomb, and seeks to atone. He also is a radio ham; he often
       talks to other hams about the Black Hills of his youth, the Male
       Voice Choir, about home. He is saddened by the use of telecommunication
       to trivialise important issues, the soap opera state. However, Live
       Aid has decynicised him to an extent. Billy listens to David and hears
       the truth the old man speaks.
        Billy experiments with his cordless 'phone, he learns to make calls.
       He accesses computers and speech synthesizers, he learns to speak.
        Billy makes contact with Jim, a DJ at Radio KAOS, a renegade rock
       station fighting a lone rear guard action against format radio. Billy
       perceives this as an act of political "entertainment" fireworks to
       focus attention away from problems at "home".
        Billy has developed his expertise with the cordless 'phone to the
       point where he can now control the most powerful computers in the
       world. He plans an "entertainment" of his own. He simulates nuclear
       attacks everywhere, but de-activates the military capabilities of "the
       powers that be" to retaliate.
        In extremes, perceptions change. Panic, comedy, compassion. In a SAC
       bunker, a soldier in a white cravat turns a key to launch the counter
       attack. Nothing happens; impotently he kicks the console, hurting his
       foot. He watches the approaching blips on the radar screen. As impact
       approaches, he thinks of his wife and kids, he puts his fingers in his
       ears.
        Silence. White out. Black Out. Lights out. It didn't happen, we're
       still alive. Billy has drained the earth of power to create his
       illusion.
        All over the dark side of the earth, candles are lit. In the pub in
       Billy's home village in Wales one man starts to sing; the other men
       join in.
        The Tide is Turning.
        Billy is home."

DSoT: The video:
 Things to look out for:
  During the titles at the end of the video, you will see that the words
       "Original Pig Concept: R. Waters"
  This was because, when the current Floyd line up went out on the road, they
  used the (infamous) inflatable pig, to float above the audience during the
  song 'One Of These Days...'. Mr Waters, however, brought (yet another) law
  suit against them, stating that the pig was all his idea. So to comply with
  this, they credited him with it, as well as changing the pigs gender!

The Wall: Live In Berlin: (The Video)
 The 'touch up work':
  'The last few thousand of the quarter million toiling out of the Potsdamer
  Platz, Berlin,20 minutes after the end of 'The Wall' were transfixed to hear
  the whole extravaganza starting up again behind them. Because of substantial
  technical hitches which afflicted the early part of the performance -
  including an expanse of dead silence at one point - and the requirements of a
  live album due for genuine "rush" release within weeks, Roger Waters and the
  producers had decided they should go straight back out and fill in the
  blanks. A few days later, with a candour unusual, veering towards the unique,
  in the history of the live album, Waters headed sceptics off at the pass by
  revealing the exact extent of the "retouching" involved. The unofficial
  after-midnight performance provided The Thin Ice (with Ute Lemper). Another
  Brick In The Wall part 1 and The Band's parts on Mother (Sinead O'Connors
  vocal, interrupted on the night,was taken from the dress rehearsal). Bryan
  Adams went into the studio to debug his version of Young Lust, Cyndi Lauper
  did likewise for Another Brick part 2, and they both added some
  extracurricular work on The Tide Is Turning, the entire cast encore. All the
  proceeds from the record are, of course, going  to Leonard Cheshire's
  International Fund For Disaster Relief.'
  From 'Q' Magazine
 The song order: Again, different from the original album. The differences:
  starts with When The Tigers Broke Free, remains true to the original until
  after Goodbye Blue Sky, where instead of Empty Spaces, we have What Shall
  We Do Now, ( which is the same as the film version). There's an extra 'jam'
  at the end of Another Brick 3, and the whole of The Show Must Go On is
  excluded. To rap it up, Waters adds his 1987 Radio K.A.O.S 'hit' single
  The Tide Is Turning, after The Trial.

FAQ:
---

Is there supposed to be a 'Twist' in the sound at the end of "The Great Gig In
The Sky" on DSOTM?

 Well its not the fault of your equipment! The 'Twist' is definitely present on
 recording of the album, it is safe to assume that it isnt. PF are real
 perfectionists when it comes to album making, so they'd have re-recorded it
 if wasn't supposed to be there.

How do I tell whether a copy of DSOTM is Quadrophonic?

 The catalogue number begins with Q4SHVL

What's so good about the gold (MFSL) PF CDs?

 Apart from being gold plated (and, therefore, supposedly to last longer than a
 normal CD), the pressings are taken from the original master recordings of
 their albums, rather than later generations that some of CD releases (namely
 The Capitol ones) seem to be taken from. They are, however, more expensive
 than the domestic releases (averaging around twice as much). Alternatively,
 you might try for the (european) Harvest pressings, or the 'Black' Japanese
 ones, as they both sound almost as good as the MFSL ones, and aren't as
 expensive.

What MFSL releases are currently available?

For those with unlimited overdraft facilities, you can get hold 24 carat gold
 plated version of DSOTM, MEDDLE, and The Wall.

I've seen a cover of ANP with a naked woman with three breasts. Is this rare?

 This is actually a bootleg called 'A Great Set', a triple album.

What is "Objects Of Fantasy"?

 "Objects Of Fantasy", is an album of floyd music played by the Royal
 Philharmonic Orchestra, and arranged by David Palmer [available on RCA records
 catalogue no. 7960-2-RC]. As to whether it's any good, all depends on how
 much you mind people a) Covering Floyd songs, b) Rearranging them.

Did The current floyd line up originally start their MLoR tour with a different
set?

 Yes, they originally had started the set with Echoes, and had Shine On... as
 a second encore, but changed it after only a few shows to that of DSoT fame.
 (to be accurate, it was played at shows between 9th and 25th September 1987).
 Also, for On The Run, they originally used the plane gag, from the original
 DSOTM tour. This was replaced by the bed.

What is the song Wish You Were Here about?

 "The lyrics which make the most sense to me now, and I'm remembering these
  from a long time ago, are the lines:-

  And did you exchange
  A walk on part in the war
  For a lead role in a cage

  It was very much suggested to me by my mother, by my whole background that
  what life was really about was being an essentially good person, doing good
  things for other people, the old notion of being here to be good, and
  working towards Utopia, brotherhood of man, all of us living together as
  brothers and sisters in a brave new world. The lines are about
  relinquishing the sense of needing to be a social worker or a freedom
  fighter or whatever. When you exchange the walk on part in the war you give
  up your role as a do-gooder, your social role. The lead role in the cage is
  "up there", the rock'n roller playing the lead role in the consumer
  society. Being a rock'n roller is a dominant image of success in our
  society, but it is a cage because the constraints are often just as great
  as they ever were. In fact they may even be greater... you've got more
  money, but you have more things, you're more involved in the tyranny of
  things. You can't buy a feeling that you're alright. You can't buy your way
  to peace of mind. You can't buy an illusion that things are getting better.
  In a way it's a schizophrenic song. It's directed at my other half if you
  like... the battling elements within myself. There's the bit that's
  concerned with other people, the bit that one applauds in oneself, then
  there's the grasping avaricious, selfish little kid who wants to get his
  hands the sweets and have them all. The song slips in and out of both
  personi so the bit that always wants to win is feeling upset and
  plaintively saying to the other side, "wish you were here". "
  Roger Waters 1982
  ...But of course, it's all a matter of personal opinion, really...

Why is there a blank LP cover on the front cover of some versions of the
Ummagumma album, and a other versions, this is filled in with the cover of the
soundtrack to the musical 'GiGi'?

 It appears that US releases of Ummagumma had the 'GiGi' LP blanked out, due
 to permission difficulties. All the other versions have it though.

Why did neither Waters or Gilmour sing "Have a Cigar" .

 Basically 'cos they both couldn't reach the notes! Roy Harper happened
 so they asked him to do it (which he did!). Roger is apparently 'unhappy'
 that he didn't sing it.

Bob Ezrin : How did he get acquainted with the band, and what role has he
to played in Pink Floyd in the recent years .

 Err, not quite sure how he got acquainted with the band (anyone?), but apart
 from co-producing The Wall (on which he also co-wrote The Trial), he's also
 co-produced Dave Gilmour's second solo piece, About Face, and todays Floyd's
 MLoR album, on which he also co-wrote Signs Of Life and Learning To Fly

I recently picked up a disc by Nick and some guy by the name of Rick Fenn,
titled Profiles ...could anyone help me out on info about it? What's the story
on Fenn?

 Rick Fenn, is formerly of 10CC, and I think may have worked with Mike
 Oldfield. Most of Profiles (as you've probably found) is instrumental,
 with the exception of a couple of tracks, Lie For A Lie and Israel, whose
 lyrics were both written by Danny Peyronel. Dave Gilmour sings on Lie For
 A Lie. (which was released as single, BTW)

Did Syd turn up during the WYWH sessions?

 "During the WYWH sessions a fat, shaven-headed person wearing grey Terylene
 trousers, a nylon shirt and string vest wandered into the studio. The band
 ignored the visitor and kept on playing and it was the visiting Andrew
 King who finally recognised their guest: 'Good God, it's Syd! How did you
 get like that?' To which Syd replied, 'I've got a very large fridge at home
 and I've been eating a lot of pork chops.' The whole event was slightly
 un-nerving since the theme of the album was based on Syd and his subsequent
 madness."

Where was DSoT filmed?

 At Nassau Coliseum, in Uniondale NY (Long Island), USA (over 2 nights)

When and why did Rick Wright leave the band?

 Rick left during the filming of The Wall, which was not confirmed until the
 release of The Final Cut. Wright has been quoted in saying that it was Roger
 who effectively told the band that if he (Wright) didn't leave, he would scrap
 the whole Wall project. Given this pressure Wright, later, just separated
 from the band. There's are other rumours, that Wright had been taking mucho
 drugs, and was particularly fit to play anyway, and that Dave was also
 getting fed up with him too.

Which One's Pink?
