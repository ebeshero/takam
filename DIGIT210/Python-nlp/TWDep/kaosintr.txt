KAOS Video Introductory Text

[this text is shown at the beginning of the Radio KAOS video]

Radios KAOS is the story of twins Benny, a welsh coalminer, and Billy, his
handicapped brother. Billy is special, he has the super natural ability to
receive RADIO WAVES directly into his mind. The pit closes, the village is
dying.

One night, drunk, after taking Billy on a pub crawl, Benny's anger overflows,
as an act of defiance he smashes the window of a hi-fi shop and takes a
cordless phone.

When the police come for Benny he hides the phone under the seat of Billy's
wheelchair. Benny goes to prison; Billy is sent to LA to live with his great
uncle David, who had gone to America during the War to work on the Atom Bomb
project and stricken with remorse after Hiroshima, had never returned to
Wales.

Billy is homesick, the cultural upheaval moving from South Wales to SUNSET
STRIP makes him realise how many of us are forced from HOME by the market
forces.

Billy experiments with the cordless phone, he learns to make calls, he
accesses computers and speech synthesisers now he can communicate.

He makes friends with Jim the DJ at Radio KAOS a renegade rock station. Billy
developes his power. He learns control. From the traffic lights of LA to the
most sophisticated military computers the world of electronics becomes his
oyster.

Billy decides to shock the world out of its market dominated, war mongering
attitude, by simulating a global nuclear attack. FOUR MINUTES and counting.
Silence, whiteout, blockout. "I just wanted everyone to know how it felt,
you, me and the POWERS THAT BE! We will learn our lesson THE TIDE IS TURNING."
