three unidentified tracks - In 1974, the Floyd went into the studio to
     record a follow-up album to THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and hit on the
     idea of using only found objects and home-made musical instruments.
     Three tracks were completed before the project was abandoned.  None
     of these tracks have ever been released or have turned up on
     bootlegs.
 
Money - (1981) Rerecorded for the compilation album A COLLECTION OF

What Shall We Do Now? - (1979) Originally, side two of THE WALL album was
     to run:
 
     Goodbye Blue Sky
     What Shall We Do Now?
     Young Lust
     One Of My Turns
     Don't Leave Me Now
     Empty Spaces
     Another Brick In The Wall, Part 3
     Goodbye Cruel World
 
     The lyrics on the inner sleeve retain this order.  "Empty Spaces"
     was originally intended to be a reprise of the longer "What Shall
     We Do Now?," but when the album was mastered, side two turned out
     to be too long, so "What Shall We Do Now?" was removed and "Empty
     Spaces" was moved up.  "What Shall We Do Now?" was reinstated in
     the film version of THE WALL, replacing "Empty Spaces."
 
When The Tigers Broke Free - single, 1982 -- From THE WALL film soundtrack.
 
THE WALL film soundtrack - (1982) The film soundtrack features the two
     previously unreleased tracks, mentioned above, as well as remixed
     and even completely rerecorded versions of tracks from THE WALL album:
