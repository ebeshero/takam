While perusing my Floyd zipfile, I found the following file.  I typed this in
years ago (I think it was late 1986 or so), taking most all of the
information from the _Visual Documentary_ by Miles.  I also added some info
from tour t-shirts.  If anyone has any additions or corrections, please let
me know.

a couple of minor additions:

> October 17 1971     San Diego, California 

	Golden Hall was the auditorium in SD.

> September 23 1972   Santa Clara Fairground, San Jose, California 

	this show never took place. Can't remember exactly why. We were
	living in SJ at the time, but decided to see them in SF for the
	(much) better ambience. Winterland was wonderful. You deadheads
	probly know that was where the 1974 GD movie was filmed.
	  Maybe all the San Jose folks bought SF tix like us ?  I actually
	thought of writing Miles about this, but never got up the energy.
	But that's no reason us eclipsers shouldn't know the sordid truth :-).

> 'Dark Side of the Moon' Tour of U.S., Canada 
> March 4 1973 thru June 28 1973

	I don't know why this tour would be singled out as *the* DSOTM
	tour. They were debuted it in 72, and played it in full *thru* '75.

> June 14 1975        Jersey City, New Jersey

	specifically, Roosevelt Stadium

> June 18 1975        Boston, Massachusetts 

	the bootlegs are labeled Boston Garden


and a question:

> British Tour 		January 20 1972-February 17-20 1972

	Does anyone know if DSOTM was played all of this tour, or just
	2/17-20/72 London ??
