# NLP 4: The Pink Floyd Documents

In my experiences running the python with my text collection, I was able to point out specific keywords and names that relate to the subject material. Some  interesting ideas were as follows:

- The documents were not lyrics, but a collection of interviews of band members over the years. I could see abbreviations for names as they are indicated in the text files, and I could find  multiple references to different things relating to the band.
- Some particular pieces of information are that  some terms such as "floyd" and "waters" were very frequent. Of course the band name would be the most frequent, however one of the members being more frequent than others makes a lot of sense. Roger Waters, the member mentioned here, is known for being very egotistical, so he is most likely interrviewed more, or brought up in interviews with other members because of his behavior with the band and his departure. He shows up very frequently in different word clusters.
- In clusters with Waters, it is noticeable that it always relates to his creative projects. Terms such as "wall" appear very frequently with Waters, because it was his idea and the album that he retained the rights to. The most of these interviews probably involve that.
- Other interesting clusters involve keywords such as "syd," specific years, as well as places like "london." These are most likely relating to the story of Syd Barrett, a founding member who had to depart the band due to mental illness. If Waters, Gilmour, and Barrett, all show up in the same cluster, which they do, it probably relates to the idea that the story of Barrett and the beginning of Pink Floyd coincide and that the band members grieve the loss of their friend.
