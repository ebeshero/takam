        <p> My name is Tyler Akam. I’m a Penn State Behrend DIGIT student that enjoys many different
            art forms such as music, film, drawing, and more. I’m working on many projects that
            involve each of these aspects, and have some already made!
            <br/> <br/>
            I really love music so some of my favorite artists are Pink Floyd, Imagine Dragons,
            Coldplay, First Aid Kit, The Alan Parsons Project, and much more! I collect vinyl
            records of my favorites.
            <br/> <br/>
            I enjoy a good narrative so some of my favorite movies include Everything Everywhere All
            at Once, Coraline, Fight Club, and more! I’ve made many video projects with some friends
            and we have many scripts written and projects in development.
            <br/> <br/>
            I like to draw sometimes, I don’t do it too often, but I have ideas for a comic book that
            I want to co-write with a partner and illustrate myself. On the other side of art, I really
            like paintings and other art pieces. My favorite artist is Edward Hopper!
