        <p>I’m a Penn State Behrend DIGIT student that enjoys many different art forms such as music, film, drawing, and more. I’m working on many projects that involve each of these aspects, and have some already made!</p>
            
        <p>I really love music so some of my favorite artists are Pink Floyd, Imagine Dragons, Coldplay, First Aid Kit, The Alan Parsons Project, and much more! I collect vinyl records of my favorites.</p>
            
        <p>I enjoy a good narrative so some of my favorite movies include Everything Everywhere All at Once, Coraline, Fight Club, and more! I’ve made many video projects with some friends and we have many scripts written and projects in development.</p>
            
        <p>I like to draw sometimes, I don’t do it too often, but I have ideas for a comic book that I want to co-write with a partner and illustrate. On the other side of art, I really like paintings and other art pieces. My favorite artist is Edward Hopper!</p>
