Shine on You Crazy Diamonds, Pt. 1-5


*Instrumental*


Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun


Shine on, you crazy diamond


Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky


Shine on, you crazy diamond




You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze


Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine




You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon


Shine on, you crazy diamond




Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light


Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)




Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision


Rode on the steel breeze


Come on, you raver, you seer of visions


Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine


*Instrumental*


Welcome to the Machine


Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine


Where have you been?
It's alright, we know where you've been


You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'


You bought a guitar to punish your ma


You didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine




Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine


What did you dream?
It's alright, we told you what to dream


You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar




So welcome to the machine


Have a Cigar


Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far
You're gonna fly high, you're never gonna die


You're gonna make it if you try, they're gonna love you


Well, I've always had a deep respect an' I mean that most sincerely


The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think


Oh, by the way, which one's Pink?






And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train




We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell-out
You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people


We're so happy we can hardly count


Everybody else is just green,
have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start, it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team


And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train


Wish You Were Here


And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it


So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell?
 Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?


Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?


Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?


How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year


Running over the same old ground, what have we found?


The same old fears, wish you were here


*Instrumental*


Shine on You Crazy Diamond, Pt. 6-9


*Instrumental*


Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far


Shine on, you crazy diamond


Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there


Shine on, you crazy diamond




And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph


And sail on the steel breeze


Come on, you boy child, 
you winner and loser


Come on, you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!


*Instrumental*
