          <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Tyler Akam. I am a student at Penn State Behrend studying in the DIGIT program, and I make short films among other kinds of projects.</p>
      <hr/>
      
      
        <p>Here is a link to my YouTube, where some of my projects lie.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9sYaoBw10McN-ey-6ScE5g">Takamator, my YouTube Channel</a>. I upload all sorts of content here.
            They are all school projects so far, as most of my personal stuff goes on a separate channel that my friend and I collaborate on.</p>
        <p> I have many creative projects planned and in progress and plan to put them all on this site as it gets more rounded out.</p>

            <!-- ebb: You can make a <section> or a <div> element just to organize different parts of the page.
      The <section> element should always have a heading element inside <h1>, <h2>, etc. to identify what's here.
     
     Using section elements and numbering your heading elements in order helps make your site maximally accessible to people who 
      read websites with screen readers, braille browsers, and other devices that don't rely exclusively on using your eyes.

            <h2>What I'm up to: </h2>
            <p>Listed here is going to be the kinds of projects I do, with some previews of what they are. More can be found under my Gallery page.</p>
