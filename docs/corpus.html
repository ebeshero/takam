            <h1>Corpus Assignment</h1>
            <section class="entries">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p> I have decided that for the Corpus assignment, I am going to compare the lyrics
                    of Pink Floyd albums to an individual Pink Floyd Album: The Wall. I chose this
                    because I have been listening to the Pink Floyd discography as of late, and
                    being able to compare The Wall, my favorite album, to the others could help me
                    understand more about their music. It should be noted that I am excluding
                    compilation albums so as to not have repeats in my assessments. I have gathered
                    all of the lyrics from Genius, the music lyric service. Any time that AntConc is
                    used, I grouped together The Wall with the rest of the Discography so that I may
                    see the consistency of different parts all together. Additionally, the text file
                    abbreviations are visible, so anything abbreviated is in the Discography, while
                    The Wall is not, so it is visible as "PF The..." in the file viewer, if the
                    importance of it is found useful to the viewer. The original transcribed text files that I analyzed are visible <a href="">here</a>.</p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p> In my analysis of The Wall and the rest of the Pink Floyd Discography I was able
                    to pull apart the lyrics that lie inside the albums. From the darker, more
                    complex album of The Wall, one can notice important words and phrases. Some of
                    these words include Run, Goodbye, Need, Home, and Crazy. In comparison, the rest
                    of the discography has a wider slew of words, but still some similar words with
                    negative undertones. Some examples are Crazy, Away, and Cold. Some more
                    interesting words appear in both albums, notable ones being Time, Feel, and the
                    recently mentioned word Crazy. One of the biggest words that show up in the
                    cloud is "Instrumental." As I was organizing the albums, I knew that the system
                    would display the word instrumental a lot, even though it wasn't a real lyric in
                    any album. I chose to keep it so that it could be studied. Instrumental solos
                    and songs in general are very common in Pink Floyd. It is an essential cog in
                    the machine of their style, and to demonstrate how often it shows up, I decided
                    to leave it in the cloud results.</p>
                <p>Another very important word includes "Time." Within the lyrics, it is usually in
                    the context of time itself, rather than as a supporting word. This is a great
                    example of how often the members of Pink Floyd write about struggles with time,
                    either as an individual or as members of a society. The main culprit of the word
                    count for "Time" is most likely a song of the same name in the album The Dark
                    Side of the Moon. It is a song that is about how time escapes us and how it
                    passes us by. As for The Wall, "Time" appears repeatedly in a few songs.
                    Notably, the KWIC gave context to this with "time to go" as a frequent phrase.
                    It serves more of a narrative-like context rather than as a main focus, but
                    still has the common theme of the concept of time pulling the character into
                    something. By this I mean that the phrase "time to go" is used as a way to
                    communicate that the story of The Wall includes aspects of time constricting
                    people. Below, images of the Word Cloud for all of the albums except The Wall
                    will be grouped together, while The Wall has its own Word Cloud just beside it.
                    I am also including an image from AntConc to show how the word "Time" comes
                    together in different albums.</p>

                    <figcaption>On the left I have included a Word Cloud of the most frequent words
                        in every album except The Wall, taking note at words such as Instrumental,
                        Home, and Time. On the right is a word cloud of The Wall, showing how often
                        certain words in this outlying album show up. By looking at this cloud and
                        the previous one, it can be noted that there are a few similarities and
                        occurences of similar themes.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>This photo provides a look into the context behind the frequency of
                        the word Time in some Pink Floyd albums. Upon examination, one can notice
                        the themes of fear and urgency that are present and associated with the
                        word.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> A few of the common NGram results I've found can be seen below. I've found that
                    some terms, such as "in the" came back as the most frequent 2-word phrase,
                    appearing 109 times. Looking at the results for 4 NGram results, I noticed
                    something very interesting that involves a difference between The Wall and the
                    rest of the Pink Floyd Discography. I noticed that there were mostly phrases
                    from lyrics included in The Wall. There weren't many results for other albums;
                    they seemed to be drowned out by The Wall. I realized that this was the amount
                    of repeated phrases said over the course of The Wall, and it made more sense.
                    The Wall is a double album, it is the longest product made by Pink Floyd, and
                    has the most concise and similar theme throughout the album. This was a great
                    thing to notice when comparing it to the Discography, as it provided insight
                    into how many repeated phrases showed up in The Wall as opposed to the
                    others.</p>

                    </div>
                    <figcaption>In these images, the results of my NGram searches are present. I
                        tried the 2 and 4 NGram options first, trying out what might be the most
                        interesting to analyze.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> While using AntConc’s Ngram counter, I found a few phrases and words that seemed
                    like they might be more useful in understanding how Pink Floyd used them in each
                    album. One phrase that stood out was “in the.” I put it into the KWIC and found
                    that even though there aren’t many direct connections apart from “in the end…”
                    appearing in multiple albums, especially The Wall, the consistency that the
                    band’s members wrote many lyrics using the prepositional phrase is apparent. It
                    may be noted that it is a common idea that the band is drawn to for reasons that
                    are potentially related to how the characters or listeners of the songs are
                    placed into the narrative. Whether a character is placed in a certain location,
                    physically or metaphorically, or if the listener is meant to be in that place or
                    imagining it using the helper words written by the band. Essentially, The Wall
                    uses it in a narrative context in almost every instance, whereas the other
                    albums include it as a simple prepositional phrase without as much intention
                    hiding behind it. From this, it is shown that The Wall is a more complex album
                    with ideas that the listener is more meant to put themself into and visualize
                    their surroundings, rather than simply relate to it.</p>
                <p> Another similar situation is seen in the word “like.” When looking through the
                    KWIC, it can be noted that the word is typically used in a context of attraction
                    to something. Other uses include it being used as a simile, letting the listener
                    interpret the music in a way that the band intended them to, but still with some
                    flexibility so as to allow the listener to form independent thoughts and
                    interpretations of the music and what it means to them. This is common between
                    every album, although I have noticed that The Wall happens to have more
                    rhetorical questions that are meant to serve as narrative points. The Wall has
                    many common themes of desire, and the nature of the word "like" in The Wall is
                    used to express that desire in a somewhat rhetorical sense, prompting the
                    listener to think about themselves along with the narrative of the main
                    character. Below is a few images of the KWIC in use, showing examples of the
                    phrase “in the” and the word “like.” I’ve also included a table of “like”
                    collocated in AntConc, and the 4 NGram table.</p>

                    <figcaption>Here are two KWIC results, one for the phrase "in the" and one for
                        the word "like." They both show the context of the phrases that I initially
                        found in the NGram tools in AntConc.</figcaption>

                <p> In conclusion, I feel that I have learned more about the albums that I listen to
                    quite frequently. I succesfully analyzed the similarities and differences in the
                    Pink Floyd Discography compared to the outstanding album that is The Wall in
                    that I found common and uncommon words and phrases that correlate between the
                    two.I essentially discovered common themes that make each album stand out,
                    especially The Wall.</p>
