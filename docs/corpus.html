            <section class="entries">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I have decided that for the Corpus assignment, I am going to compare the lyrics
                    of Pink Floyd albums to an individual Pink Floyd Album: The Wall. I chose this
                    because I have been listening to the Pink Floyd discography as of late, and
                    being able to compare The Wall, my favorite album, to the others could help me
                    understand more about their music. It should be noted that I am excluding
                    compilation albums so as to not have repeats in my assessments.</p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>In my analysis of The Wall and the rest of the Pink Floyd Discography I was able
                    to pull apart the lyrics that lie inside the albums. From the darker, more
                    complex album of The Wall, one can notice important words and phrases. Some of
                    these words include Run, Goodbye, Need, Home, and Crazy. In comparison, the rest
                    of the discography has a wider slew of words, but still some similar words with
                    negative undertones. Some examples are Crazy, Away, and Cold. Some more
                    interesting words appear in both albums, notable ones being Time, Feel, and the
                    recently mentioned word Crazy. One of the biggest words that show up in the
                    cloud is "Instrumental." As I was organizing the albums, I knew that the system
                    would display the word instrumental a lot, even though it wasn't a real lyric in
                    any album. I chose to keep it so that it could be studied. Instrumental solos
                    and songs in general are very common in Pink Floyd. It is an essential cog in
                    the machine of their style, and to demonstrate how often it shows up, I decided
                    to leave it in the cloud results. Another very important word includes "Time."
                    Within the lyrics, it is usually in the context of time itself, rather than as a
                    supporting word. This is a great example of how often the members of Pink Floyd
                    write about struggles with time, either as an individual or as members of a
                    society. The main culprit of the word count for "Time" is most likely a song of
                    the same name in the album The Dark Side of the Moon. It is a song that is about
                    how time escapes us and how it passes us by. Below, images of the Word Cloud for
                    all of the albums except The Wall will be grouped together, while The Wall has
                    its own Word Cloud just beneath it. I am also including an image from AntConc to
                    show how the word "Time" comes together in different albums.</p>

                    <figcaption>On the left I have included a Word Cloud of the most frequent words
                        in every album except The Wall, taking note at words such as Instrumental,
                        Home, and Time. On the right is a word cloud of The Wall, showing how often
                        certain words in this outlying album show up. By looking at this cloud and
                        the previous one, it can be noted that there are a few similarities and
                        occurences of similar themes.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>This photo provides a look into the context behind the frequency of
                        the word Time in some Pink Floyd albums. Upon examination, one can notice
                        the themes of fear and urgency that are present and associated with the
                        word.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>A few of the common NGram results I've found can be seen below. I've found that
                    some terms, such as "in the" came back as the most frequent 2-word phrase,
                    appearing 109 times. Looking at the results for 4 NGram results, I noticed
                    something very interesting that involves a difference between The Wall and the
                    rest of the Pink Floyd Discography. I noticed that there were mostly phrases
                    from lyrics included in The Wall. There weren't many results for other albums;
                    they seemed to be drowned out by The Wall. I realized that this was the amount
                    of repeated phrases said over the course of The Wall, and it made more sense.
                    The Wall is a double album, it is the longest product made by Pink Floyd, and
                    has the most concise and similar theme throughout the album. This was a great
                    thing to notice when comparing it to the Discography.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>While using AntConc’s Ngram counter, I found a few phrases and words that seemed
                    like they might be more useful in understanding how Pink Floyd used them in each
                    album. One phrase that stood out was “in the.” I put it into the KWIC and found
                    that even though there aren’t many direct connections apart from “in the end…”
                    appearing in multiple albums, especially The Wall, the consistency that the
                    band’s members wrote many lyrics using the prepositional phrase. It may be noted
                    that it is a theme the band draws to for reasons potentially related to how the
                    characters or listeners of the songs are placed into the narrative. Whether a
                    character is placed in a certain location, physically or metaphorically, or if
                    the listener is meant to be in that place or imagining it using the helper words
                    written by the band. Another similar situation is seen in the word “like.” When
                    looking through the KWIC, it can be noted that the word is typically used in a
                    context of attraction to something. Other uses include it being used as a
                    simile, letting the listener interpret the music in a way that they intend them
                    to, but still with some flexibility so as to allow the listener to form
                    independent thoughts and interpretations of the music and what it means to them.
                    This is common between every album, although I have noticed that The Wall
                    happens to have more rhetorical questions that are meant to serve as narrative
                    points. Below is a few images of the KWIC in use, showing examples of the phrase
                    “in the” and the word “like.” I’ve also included a table of “like” collocated in
                    AntConc, and the 4 NGram table.</p>

                        found in the NGram tools in AntConc.</figcaption>
