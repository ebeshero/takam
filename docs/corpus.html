            <h1>Corpus Assignment</h1>
            <section class="entries">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I have decided that for the Corpus assignment, I am going to compare the lyrics
                    of Pink Floyd albums to an individual Pink Floyd Album: The Wall. I chose this
                    because I have been listening to the Pink Floyd discography as of late, and
                    being able to compare The Wall, my favorite album, to the others could help me
                    understand more about their music. It should be noted that I am excluding
                    compilation albums so as to not have repeats in my assessments.</p>
                <h3>Entry 1</h3>
                <p>To show how the albums share characteristics, I grouped them together and made a
                    word cloud out of them using Voyant Tools. I've noticed similar word usages
                    across each album, such as the word "Home" and found more common themes between
                    all of them. One of the biggest words that show up in the cloud is
                    "Instrumental." As I was organizing the albums, I knew that the system would
                    display the word instrumental a lot, even though it wasn't a real lyric in any
                    album. I chose to keep it so that it could be studied. Instrumental solos and
                    songs in general are very common in Pink Floyd. It is an essential cog in the
                    machine of their style, and to demonstrate how often it shows up, I decided to
                    leave it in the cloud results. Another notable word includes "Time." Within the
                    lyrics, it is usually in the context of time itself, rather than as a supporting
                    word. This is a great example of how often the members of Pink Floyd write about
                    struggles with time, either as an individual or as members of a society. The
                    main culprit of the word count for "Time" is most likely a song of the same name
                    in the album The Dark Side of the Moon. It is a song that is about how time
                    escapes us and how it passes us by. Below, images of the Word Cloud for all of
                    the albums except The Wall will be grouped together, while The Wall has its own
                    Word Cloud just beneath it. I am also including an image from AntConc to show
                    how the word "Time" comes together in different albums.</p>
