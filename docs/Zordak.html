                <h1>An Intro to Zordak</h1>
                <p>Zordak is an indie game being developed by indie developer Apapappa Games, posted
                    on Itch.io. The game is inspired by games like Super Metroid, and is available
                    as a demo <a href="https://apapappa.itch.io/zordak">here!</a> I'm going to be
                    using a kumu network to visualize some of the elements of the game that I have
                    encountered, and use it to to look deeper into the game and review it.</p>

                <p>Here's some images from the game to showcase what it looks like, and what some of
                    my journey so far has looked like.</p>

                        location to a save file and lets the player respawn there if they happen to
                        die in-game.</figcaption>

                </figure>
                <p>One major detail that can help players understand the game based off of the Kumu
                    Network is that the root of everything is based on the planet Zordak. At first
                    glance of the network, it can be noticed that there is mystery in what is
                    happening, and I think that ties in with the fact that players are faced with
                    mystery when they begin a new save on Zordak. There is no immediate direction
                    other than to find human life. In my adventures in the game so far, I have not
                    discovered other life at all, except for the ones that try to kill me. So when
                    looking at the Kumu Network, there is an absence of life outside of enemies, as
                    it is reflective of my journey so far in the game.</p>
                <p>There is a noticeable connection between all of the equipment that is found
                    around the map. Upon a closer look at my network, it can be seen that equipment
                    is found in different areas, along with enemies. This shows the progression that
                    a player sees as they go through the game. For example, if starting at the node
                    "geo suit" it can be traced through different connections to show what it is,
                    which in this case is a weapon, and where it was found, which happens to be in
                    Exterra. This can be done for any node on the network, allowing the complete
                    progression of the game and where the player goes. </p>

                <h1>Game Review</h1>
                <p>I have enjoyed my experience with Zordak thus far. I have not completed it yet,
                    but I can provide insight on what the game plays like, and how it functions as a
                    whole. I am going to discuss the gameplay, narrative, and visual looks, along
                    with any other important element that is worth bringing into the spotlight.</p>
                <p>Firstly, the gameplay is very enjoyable. It has a lot to offer for me in the
                    types of games I like to play. Being able to explore a small area and then fight
                    a challenging boss is very fun to me. In terms of pacing, it felt nearly
                    perfect. I explored throughout the tutorial, learned the basics of the game
                    mechanics, found my basic equipment, and got an understanding of the puzzle
                    system. Then, after encountering a newer range of enemies that were not
                    available before I obtained my suit, I came across an area that just had "boss"
                    written all over it. The areaa was near a save point, and as I progressed
                    through the few rooms, there was a change in the atmosphere. The air seemed off,
                    there was a gelatinous substance dripping from the ceiling. Then I entered one
                    specific room and all was quiet except the dripping of the gelatinous slime. A
                    boss named Slither appeared. The atmospherics leading up to the boss fight were
                    truly immersive and kind of put me in a position to be unsure and questionable
                    about what is coming. That's my experience progressing through the game, but
                    even as I felt immersed and involved in the game at this point, there is more to
                    discuss about the gameplay.</p>
                <p>As previously stated, the gameplay, which includes the journey I've had so far,
                    is very interesting and enjoyable. There are downsides, though. As a PC game, I
                    do not particularly like the default controls. This is a subjective matter, but
                    the controls felt awkward at times. It was purely based on keyboard use, and
                    there was no option for using a mouse. If I could use a mouse, the combat and
                    movement would be easier for me, as opposed to trying to manually aim in
                    intervals. However, in the case of controller support, I think that the current
                    movement system would work just fine. I also found it bothersome that I cannot
                    jump and attack at the same time. Many times during the Slither boss fight, I
                    tried to jump to dodge while trying to maintain the amount of damage I took. To
                    me, the game appears to be a game where the player is meant to keep moving, but
                    if I cannot output damage, then I end up standing still as I fight with some
                    controls. This did not make the game unplayable, though. It is subjective, and
                    more practice and time getting used to the controls could solve this issue on
                    the player's end. Other than that, finding new equipment and exploring areas
                    until encountering a boss is a very fun and exciting realm of gameplay.</p>
                <p>The narrative for the game is very intriguing. There is not much given away at
                    the beginning, letting the player indulge the mystery and incite them to
                    continue playing to figure out the story. After being crash landed on a planet
                    they were meant to explore, the player exits cryosleep long after the time they
                    were supposed to, and everything is in ruin. The player's task is to find human
                    life, and that's enough to keep the player playing. I kept finding myself
                    anticipating moving on from an area in favor of finding more narrative to
                    uncover. The only issue that I have with this system is that it would be cool if
                    there were things such as collectible that tell a story related to the main one.
                    Once I figured out that there was nothing to explore for, I left exploration
                    behind so that I may experience a more interactive part of the game -- combat.
                    Essentially, the game prides itself on mystery, and that is great. It makes me,
                    as a player, want to know the answers to the questions given to me.</p>
                <p>Visually, the art style is amazing to me. I like art styles that follow rules and
                    make themselves unique at the same time. The visual look to Zordak felt
                    familiar, but brand new at the same time, and that's because the game focused on
                    building the environment so much. From looking at the inner ruins of the ship to
                    the overgrown parts of Exterra, the game looked and felt unique in every area I
                    had explored. The sound design felt immersive and fun. The game also had these
                    scan lines as a filter over the game to give it a sort of monitor-like look that
                    I really enjoyed. It reminded me of the film grain and damage in the game
                    Cuphead, which I loved very much. It felt like it was more unique and added to
                    the retro kind of visual style that the game was going for. Overall, the visuals
                    and designs of all of the assets were amazing and super dynamic, especially when
                    the wind blows them around and other events happen around the map.</p>
