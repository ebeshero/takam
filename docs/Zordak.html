                <h1>An Intro to Zordak</h1>
                <p>Zordak is an indie game being developed by indie developer Apapappa Games, posted
                    on Itch.io. The game is inspired by games like Super Metroid, and is available
                    as a demo <a href="https://apapappa.itch.io/zordak">here!</a> I'm going to be
                    using a kumu network to visualize some of the elements of the game that I have
                    encountered, and use it to to look deeper into the game and review it.</p>

                <p>Here's some images from the game to showcase what it looks like, and what some of
                    my journey so far has looked like.</p>

                    <figcaption>The title screen that players see when first launching the game. It
                        looks very intriguing and offers mystery to interested players.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The damaged helmet item that players find in the beginning of the
                        game. It is cosmetic and defines the character's look.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>A save point found in the game. They can be activated by pressing a
                        certain button, which prompts an animation and saves the plauer's current
                        location to a save file and lets the player respawn there if they happen to
                        die in-game.</figcaption>

                <figure>

                    <figcaption>This is the screen that players see upon death. They have the option to either quit the game or continue from their last save point.</figcaption>
