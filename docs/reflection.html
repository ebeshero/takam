            <p> During my DIGIT 100 class at Penn State Behrend, I have begun designing websites.
                The first site, Wordpress, was actually quite simple to become acquainted with. I
                was able to pick a theme and apply it to my site and make it look rather
                professional in a matter of minutes. The second site I’ve worked on has been much
                harder. Being a GitHub site, I basically have a blank canvas and can apply whatever
                I want, as long as I know how to do it. With some research and troubleshooting, I
                can accomplish what the Wordpress site does, and it feels more satisfying. 
                <br/> <br/>
             From the two experiences creating sites, I enjoyed the GitHub page more. It provided
                a challenge that I felt I could overcome, and could also control every aspect of the
                site. Even though the GitHub site is not as complex and is simpler, it holds a more
                original feel and that matches my aspirations. Going forward, I want to continue
                developing the GitHub site to expand my knowledge of HTML and CSS. The wordpress
                site looks nicer, but I feel disconnected from it and it seems like I cannot truly
                control it. 
                <br/> <br/>
            
             GitHub is much harder for developing a website. I have to design and code every part
                of my site, and implement it in a way that actually looks like a website and
                integration of my interests. My most important section is my Gallery, as it
                showcases what I’ve been up to in my classes and outside of school in my personal
                projects. In this case, I need to properly format them so that they look nicer and
                more professional. My biggest issues so far include mistakes in my HTML and CSS
                codes that conflict with other elements that prevent me from altering what I want
                to. My solution to this has been simply looking up what elements to use to format my
                content differently, along with troubleshooting my issue. This can be difficult as I
                attempt to learn a new element of style for every different thing that I want to add
                or change, but I have found that it is very helpful to try whatever I can and see
                what unique additions I can make! 
            <br/> <br/>
             Overall, I enjoyed learning how to build a site from scratch. This will be very
                useful to me, so I will definitely be working on expanding the site and making it
                more advanced as I go forward. My wordpress site will remain available, but GitHub
                will be the primary location for information about me and my creative endeavors.
